As we work through each paper-based form that we have been task to recreate online, there is on occasion something very analogue that doesn't translate directly.

This is one of those times.

The Index Numbers of Imports Prices survey (informally called Prices) used the paper format to allow users to add amendments to product information directly as they were completing the form. There was a checkbox to indicate a change, which would raise a flag on the scanning system and require a person to read the amendments and manually add them in. This should then go back upstream to update our source data. The updates were written into a single comments box on the back of the form.
