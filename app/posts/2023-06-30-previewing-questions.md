Recently we were asked by the designer on the Author team about the new ability to preview questions, as they had some questions about why we include the title of the question and then the labels, as it didn't make sense to include the labels other than maybe checkboxes or labels

[Prototype](https://eq-v2-prototypes-tjfamtqorq-nw.a.run.app/) linked in [trello card](https://trello.com/c/BipDuXxj/5391-viewing-questions-before-starting-the-survey-iteration-1-5-sp)


![alt text for screen readers](/previewing-questions/author-example.png "Caption here")

Kicked off last July after a week-long technical spike into the feasibility:
Goals
The ability to preview the questions before starting the questionnaire

Why do we want to do this
Improved UX but allowing to prepare and gather materials required to complete the questionnaire.

User story
As a respondent
I want to preview the questions
So that I can pre-prepare the materials need for my response

Acceptance Criteria
Given a survey with preview questions enabled
When I am on the introduction page
Then I can see and access the preview questions link

Technical details
Since this is a spike, this will focus purely on runner. Validator will need to be considered for the non spike work.

New authenticated endpoint in runner that is used to preview the questions.
This link can be hardcoded into the introduction block for now.
Non metadata Placeholders should not be rendered but we still want to output the question as is.
Look to introduce a new context which is responsible to creating the model needed to render the preview page. The preview page is somewhat similar to the summary page.
Reuse existing templates
No automated tests are needed for the spike.
Needs to support:
- Question title
- Question description
- Guidance Include / exclude panel (Guidance)
- Answer instruction
- Answer label
- Answer description
- Answer values (checkbox, radios, dropdowns) (*Nice to have)
- Variants (Use first)
- Metadata for placeholders (render)
- Hide confirmation questions
- Only question pages
- Linear will be in one twisty
- Print / PDF by browser
- Toggleable by schema
- Section titles as twisties



Some observations:
- in business schemas section titles are often missing, in such cases default value is used for twisty title purposes
- for summaries in runner we use group titles, some of the business schemas are missing those fields
- autogenerated placeholder names are unreadable and ambiguous in questions preview, should be replaced with something more intuitive
- preview question toggle is always “on” for testing purposes but I left some optional code to make it switchable, it will require extra top level argument in schemas (and extra cookie value if we go ahead with this solution)
- existing placeholder renderer will require some work to generate placeholders correctly for preview questions (and will require something like the new preview question argument to be passed down from placeholder parser), otherwise it is mainly new classes and endpoints (if the devs decide to use the solution to placeholder generation from the PR)


Its been decided to move answer guidance out of scope for this iteration as there is issues that need to be addressed in the DS when details components are used inside an accordion. These will be fixed in the DS and introduced in iteration 2. So for now answer guidance wont work.


Respondents must be able to see all questions (with relevant information) that they may be asked

Respondents must understand that this is not the actual survey

Respondents must be able to save or print a copy of the questions

Respondents must understand that they will only have to answer relevant questions

Questions must be understandable through either use of rendered metadata or placeholder names in parentheses

Feature must be able to be removed from a survey if not wanted

Link will always show above the Start survey button on the introduction page (not configurable by Author)

Checkbox, radio and dropdown answer types will all display "You can answer with the following options:" before the answers

Mutually exclusive answers will be treated as normal answers

Character limits will be displayed for text areas
