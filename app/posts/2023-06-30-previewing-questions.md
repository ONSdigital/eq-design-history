Recently we were asked by the designer on the Author team about the new ability to preview questions, as they had some questions about why we include the title of the question and then the labels, as it didn't make sense to include the labels other than maybe checkboxes or labels

[Prototype](https://eq-v2-prototypes-tjfamtqorq-nw.a.run.app/) linked in [trello card](https://trello.com/c/BipDuXxj/5391-viewing-questions-before-starting-the-survey-iteration-1-5-sp)


![screenshot showing a list of example question titles and the labels that wouldbe on the page](/previewing-questions/author-example.png "Example created by Author designer, showing that the question title and the label of the input are previewed")

The work was kicked off last July (2022) after a week-long technical spike into the feasibility. We wanted to do this to improve UX by allowing users to prepare and gather materials required to complete the questionnaire before they start.

The acceptance criteria lists the support needs of the component as:
- Question title
- Question description
- Guidance Include / exclude panel (Guidance)
- Answer instruction
- Answer label
- Answer description
- Answer values (checkbox, radios, dropdowns) (*Nice to have)
- Variants (Use first)
- Metadata for placeholders (render)
- Hide confirmation questions
- Only question pages
- Linear will be in one twisty
- Print / PDF by browser
- Toggleable by schema
- Section titles as twisties



Some observations were noted at the time:
- in business schemas section titles are often missing, in such cases default value is used for twisty title purposes
- for summaries in runner we use group titles, some of the business schemas are missing those fields
- autogenerated placeholder names are unreadable and ambiguous in questions preview, should be replaced with something more intuitive
- preview question toggle is always “on” for testing purposes but I left some optional code to make it switchable, it will require extra top level argument in schemas (and extra cookie value if we go ahead with this solution)
- existing placeholder renderer will require some work to generate placeholders correctly for preview questions (and will require something like the new preview question argument to be passed down from placeholder parser), otherwise it is mainly new classes and endpoints (if the devs decide to use the solution to placeholder generation from the PR)


It was been decided to move answer guidance out of scope for this iteration as there were issues that needed to be addressed in the DS when details components are used inside an accordion. These will be fixed in the DS and introduced in iteration 2. So for now answer guidance won't work.
